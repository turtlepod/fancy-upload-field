## Upload Field

### Why?

Most of the time, we can simply use media modal to upload file in WordPress, but sometimes it's not the best may to do upload.

Example: For front-end (not in WP-admin), form where user is not logged in, or have caps to manage files but we still want files to be uploaded to WP media manager. etc (tons of reason).
